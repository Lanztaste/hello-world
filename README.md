Nature Lover
I am a nature lover. Love to travel and hoping to see the northern lights someday. I love to look at snowy mountains and trees.
I love coffee too!  My new passion is coding. I love listening to original songs from JW App. I like cats and dogs. I can cook food for my family, my specialty is sphagetti! Would you like some? I am happily married and have one lovely daughter.
